This is my Codecademy project where I created a webpage for a fictitious teashop based on a spec sheet.

I took some creative liberties with the assignment:

1. The text backgrounds overlaid on images are supposed to be opaque black, but that was ugly so did semi-transparent
2. I added divider lines between sections of the page since it was all jumbly without them in my opinion

I had to use negative margins in the Locations section of the CSS to get the text positioned the way I wanted. Any tips
on how to do this better would be appreciated!

Any other tips on making my code more efficient are most welcome as well.
